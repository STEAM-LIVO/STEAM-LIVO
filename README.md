**STEAM-LIVO: Spatio-Temporally Adaptive Manifold Lidar-Inertial-Visual Odometry for Sensor Degradation in Unstructured Natural Aquatic-Terrestrial Scenes**

STEAM-LIVO is a novel odometry algorithm that demonstrates strong performance in **unstructured natural scenes**, particularly under sensor degradation conditions.

The related paper is currently under review.  
The code will be made publicly available after acceptance.
